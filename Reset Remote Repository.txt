Reset Remote Repository
=========================

 Warning: Force-pushing can overwrite history and affect anyone else working with the repository. Use with caution.

 Steps to Reset Remote Repository to a Previous Commit
================================================

 1. Identify the Commit You Want to Reset To:

Use this to view commit history:


git log --oneline


Example output:


f9a8e12 Fix typo
a7b5c3d Add login feature  ← You want to reset to this
9d7c2e1 Initial commit


 2. Reset Local Repository to That Commit:


git reset --hard a7b5c3d


 3. Force Push to Remote:


git push origin main --force


> Replace main with the name of your branch (like master, dev, etc.)

 Use Case Example:
================

If your team pushed wrong commits to main branch and you want to undo them and reset remote:


git reset --hard <correct_commit_hash>
git push origin main --force


 Safer Alternative (without history loss)
===================================

If you don’t want to lose history, prefer a revert:


git revert <commit_hash>
git push origin main


This creates a new commit that undoes the changes, keeping history intact.
