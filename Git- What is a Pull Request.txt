 What is a Pull Request?
=====================

A Pull Request (PR) is a collaborative request to merge changes from one branch or repository into another. It is commonly used in platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.

 You raise a PR when you want someone to review your changes and then merge them into their repository/branch.

 Example Scenario:

1. You fork a repo awesome-project from someone else's GitHub.
2. You make changes in your own fork.
3. You send a pull request to the original repo to request them to merge your changes.
