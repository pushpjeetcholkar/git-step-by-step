Git Practical Assignment â€“ Version Control Basics
=============================================

By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:

Initialize a local Git repository

Track files and commit changes

Create and switch branches

Merge branches

Understand HEAD, origin, and remote tracking

Use common Git commands in daily work

Instructions
=============

Follow the steps below and submit screenshots or Git logs as proof of completion.

 Step 1: Create a Local Repository
Create a new folder called git-practice.

Initialize it as a Git repository.

mkdir git-practice
cd git-practice
git init

 Step 2: Add and Commit Files
Create a file called intro.txt and add your name and a short intro.

Add and commit it.

echo "My name is [Your Name], learning Git!" > intro.txt
git add intro.txt
git commit -m "Added intro file"

 Step 3: Create and Work on a New Branch
Create a new branch dev.

git branch dev
git checkout dev

Create a file feature.txt and add some content to it.

Add and commit the changes in dev.

echo "This is a new feature." > feature.txt
git add feature.txt
git commit -m "Added feature file in dev branch"

 Step 4: Merge Branch
Switch back to main branch.

Merge dev into main.

git checkout main
git merge dev

Confirm that feature.txt now exists in main.

  
 Step 5: View Log and HEAD

Run the following command and take a screenshot of the output:


git log --oneline --graph --all
Observe where HEAD is pointing and the state of branches.

 Step 6 (Optional): Simulate Remote
Create a remote repository on GitHub or GitLab.

Link your local repo:

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/git-practice.git
git push -u origin main
Create a pull request from dev to main (if working with GitHub).

 Submission
===========

A zipped folder of your local repository OR GitHub repository link

Screenshots of:
git status
git log
git branch

Your feature.txt and intro.txt contents
