What is a Pull Request (PR) in Git?
==============================

A Pull Request (commonly called PR) is a way to propose changes from one branch to another — especially in collaborative environments (like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

>   It does not pull anything. The term means:
> "I’m requesting you to pull my changes into your branch."


Where It’s Used
============

 GitHub
 GitLab
 Bitbucket
  These platforms allow developers to submit pull requests, discuss the code, request reviews, and merge once approved.

 Use Case (Simple Example)
==========================

 Scenario:

 You are working on a project hosted on GitHub.
 Main branch: main
 You create a new feature branch: new-feature
 You add code and push it to GitHub.

Now, you want this new-feature to be merged into main.

 Step-by-Step Example
====================
bash
 Step 1: Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
cd repo

 Step 2: Create a branch
git checkout -b new-feature

 Step 3: Make changes and commit
echo "New feature added" >> feature.txt
git add feature.txt
git commit -m "Added feature.txt"

 Step 4: Push to GitHub
git push origin new-feature

 Step 5: Create Pull Request

1. Go to your GitHub repo in the browser.
2. GitHub will show a banner:
   "Compare & pull request" → Click it.
3. Add a title, description, and click "Create pull request".
4. Team members can now review and comment.

 Final Step
=========

Once reviewed, click Merge Pull Request to merge it into main.
