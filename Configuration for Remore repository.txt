1. git push origin master

Pushes your local branch (master) to the remote repository named origin.

origin: Default name for your remote repository (usually GitHub, GitLab, etc.).

master: The branch you're pushing (in many newer repos, it's called main instead of master).

 2. --set-upstream
===============
Tells Git to link your local master branch with the remote master branch at origin.

This means:

Next time, you can simply type git push or git pull without mentioning the remote or branch name.

Git remembers the relationship between your local and remote branches.

 Example Scenario:
================
You just created a new local branch master, and it's not yet linked to the remote master:


git push --set-upstream origin master
After this, Git links them together, so in the future:


git push        # Will push to origin/master
git pull        # Will pull from origin/master
