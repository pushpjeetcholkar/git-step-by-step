
You merge the feature branch into the main branch to bring its changes into the main development line.

 Example: Step-by-Step Merge Process
=======================================
You have:

 master branch with initial code
 new-feature branch with new changes

 Step 1: Switch to the Main Branch


git checkout master


 Step 2: Merge the Feature Branch into Main


git merge new-feature


Now, all the changes from new-feature will be added into master.

 Step 3: Check the Result


cat file.txt


You will now see content from both master and new-feature.

 Step 4 (Optional): Push the Updated Master to Remote


git push origin master


 Behind the Scenes
===============

 Git finds the common ancestor of both branches.
 It then applies the changes from the feature branch to the current branch.
 If there are conflicts, Git will stop and ask you to resolve them manually.
